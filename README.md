# CustomSnackbar

The CustomSnackbar is an Android app written with Android Studio 2.3.3 the 
minimum Api 23 Build Tools Api 25 and Compile Sdk Version Api 26

This is a demo application that was written to explore the most efficient way to design and manage the styling of a Custom Snackbar. The demo app shows three different design paradigms. Each design works but some designs require too much code manipulation to be effective for various devises and screen sizes. 

This demo explores the use of the following
Snackbar widget
CoordinatorLayout widget
CountDownTimer

Intended Audience Beginner to Novice If youâ€™re a professional programmer please do not comment unless you are willing to provide corrected code as I am a Novice and if I knew what was wrong I would have fixed it.

I hope you enjoy the code and that it provides you with an easy to use Custom Snackbar
